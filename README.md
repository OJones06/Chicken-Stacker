# 🐔 Mob Stacker

A lightweight Fabric server-side mod for Minecraft 1.21.x that automatically stacks adult chickens together. Built for Ryan Trahan fans following along with his series — keep your server running smooth no matter how many chickens pile up.

## Features

- Automatically detects and stacks nearby adult chickens
- Displays stack count above the chicken's name
- Server-side only — no client mods needed for players
- Singleplayer compatible

## Prerequisites

Before installing Mob Stacker, make sure you have the following set up:

1. **Minecraft Server 1.21.x**
2. **Fabric Loader** — Download from [fabricmc.net](https://fabricmc.net/)
3. **Fabric API** — Download from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

## Installation

1. Download the latest `mobstacker-x.x.x.jar` from the [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Place the `.jar` file into your server's `mods` folder.
3. Make sure **Fabric API** is also in the `mods` folder.
4. Start (or restart) your server.
5. That's it — chickens will begin stacking automatically!

## FAQ

**Do players need to install anything?**
Nope. This is a server-side mod, so players can join with a vanilla client.

**Does it stack baby chickens?**
No — only adult chickens are stacked.

**Can I use this on a singleplayer world?**
Yes, as long as you're running Fabric with the Fabric API installed.

**Do loot and egg drops still work?**
Yes, eggs are dropped at {num}x the rate of one chicken. When you kill your chicken stack, the correct number of drops is applied, even with looting!
